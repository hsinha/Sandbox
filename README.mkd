Hamper is an [irc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) bot.
Most IRC Bot's provide functionality to an IRC channel.

Such functionality depends on the bot. In this case hamper:

- Answers boolean/yes/no questions. Also answers 'or' questions.
  - Eg: me: "Hamper: Is the world going to end?" Hamper: "No, no I dont think so".
  - Shortens long urls to [bit.ly urls](https://bitly.com/).
  - Stores quotes, for later.

Theres a ton of functionality that can be added to the bot. Especially command
wise. Its a very good way to get familiar with things, especially in a real project
situation with other developers.

Installation
============
Hamper has an official version in pip, however, for our purposes, you will want
to grab the git version, so you can make changes to the code.

Set up for Hamper is fairly easy. Set up instructions will be with
[pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). Pip is a python package installer and
if you do not already have it, it should be easily available through most
package managers.

For those that want to install dependencies inside the project instead of
globally, you will need to install [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)

Dependencies
------------

-   Twisted
-   SQLAlchemy
-   PyYaml

To install the current set of required dependencies:

    cd hamper/
    pip install -r requirements.txt


Configuration
=============
Make a file named `hamper.conf`. This should be a YAML file containing these
fields:

-   `nickname`
-   `channels`
-   `server`
-   `port`
-   `db` - A database URL as described [here][dburl]

For a place to start, you can copy `hamper.conf.dist` to `hamper.conf` and adjust it as needed.

[dburl]: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine

Usage
=====
You need to make sure that hamper is on your python path.

    PYTHONPATH="." python2 ./scripts/hamper

Plugin Development
==================
Read `hamper/plugins/friendly.py`. Add a file to `hamper/plugins`, and write
plugins in it. Don't forget to create an instance of each one at the bottom.

To get your changes added to the main repo:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo.
2. Make some [changes](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository),
   and commit them.
3. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
   and someone will take a look at the code. If it looks good and ready to add
   to the main repo we'll merge it in.
4. Huzzah, your change is now a part of our project, and you've contributed to
   an open source project.
